This is a personal portfolio website of mine

The old webiste was made in about 48 hours with very limited knowledge of HTML and CSS.
The new and improved website was made during the second semester of 2025, and finally published during the summer of 2025

The original project was a learning project, where I tried doing as much as possible on my own,
without any assistance from AI/Copilor or just stealing source code from websites that already exist.

However, in the aftermath I was rather disatisfied with how it turned out, and since I'm not a webdevelopper,
nor do I ever plan on becoming one, I decided that I would let myself use any tools availible to improve the site.
Most of the HTML is still made, as I wanted to design the site after my visions, but when it comes to designing it,
I must admit I got a lot of help.
